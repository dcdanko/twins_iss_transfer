The colors indicate the likely source of the new taxon if it was found previously in the saliva (for fecal samples, vice versa for saliva samples), the ISS, both (Mixed), or neither.

Boxplots indicate an artificial reference distribution generated by randomly permuting timestamps. Red and blue dots indicate actual values.

Colored bars represent 100bp covered, on average, at the specified read depth. A number of contigs are only covered in TW during and after flight.
