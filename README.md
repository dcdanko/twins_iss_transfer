# Microbial Transfer Between an Astronaut and the ISS

This repository contains the manuscript and analysis code for a scientific study showing genetic evidence for microbial transfer between an astronaut and the ISS.

    
Our core argument goes like this:

 - New microbial taxa are found in the gut microbiome for every sample in our timeseries
 - The new taxa often match taxa onboard the ISS or in the astronaut's saliva
 - There are more new taxa in our timeseries than we get by resampling the same sample over and over again
 - Some of the new taxa exactly match strains (genomic regions and SNPs) found on the ISS
